## core concept
- relies on corrlation obtained in the lab added to a more or less simplified local balance energy


## pros & cons
- :) relatively fast computation.
- :) estimate propagation and the intensity of fires.
- :( it is difficult to infer experimental result if the range of parameters is not exactly the one involved inf lab.
