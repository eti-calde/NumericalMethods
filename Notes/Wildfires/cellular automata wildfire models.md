## core concept
- Consist in modelling the forest as a set of nodes on a generally square lattice.
- The nodes can be in three states: unburned, burning or burnt.
- A probabilistic transition law involving the state of the node and the states of the neighbouring nodes governs the evolution.

## pros & cons
- :) simple rules -> fast computation
- :) can easily introduce the [[percolation]] in the model.
- :( tend to produce non physical simulation
- :( no tentative to rely the transition law on some physical parameters defining the state of the forest.
