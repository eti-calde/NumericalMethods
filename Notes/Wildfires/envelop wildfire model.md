## core idea
- under the action of wind and slope in a uniform forest, the front fire, coming from a source point, propagates as an ellipsis
- between time $t$ and $t + dt$, all point of the fire front are source points and the fire front at time $t + dt$ is the envelop of all these ellipses. 

## pros & cons
- :) Once the parameters have been fitted, this model produce realistic scenarios of propagation. 
- :( It fails to work, if the fire front enclosed a non-convex domain. 
- :( There is no relation between the geometrical parameters and the physical balance laws and physical parameters of the forest.
